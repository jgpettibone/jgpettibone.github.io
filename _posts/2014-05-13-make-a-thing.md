## Make a Thing
There was [a great presentation](https://draftin.com/documents/329520?mode=presentation&token=YfQRjZOYZz3vSaElvGAzm3oCZnD6MxOdcd143D5rH0ARfB4h25xcygLeIbfBkCilI2BBMXrjIP3gfyShnCgS518#0) today by one of my students, Zach Pomerantz.  He took us through his process for making a bookmarklet.  His bookmarklet is called [freaq](http://www.freaq.io/) and it's an audio visualizer for YouTube.  Very cool.
