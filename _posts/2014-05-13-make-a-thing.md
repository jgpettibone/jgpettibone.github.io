## The `freaq` bookmarklet
One of my students, Zach Pomerantz, created a bookmarklet called [freaq](http://www.freaq.io/) that is an audio visualizer for YouTube.  Very cool.  He also gave [a great presentation](https://draftin.com/documents/329520?mode=presentation&token=YfQRjZOYZz3vSaElvGAzm3oCZnD6MxOdcd143D5rH0ARfB4h25xcygLeIbfBkCilI2BBMXrjIP3gfyShnCgS518#0) about his process for making this bookmarklet and for using npm.
