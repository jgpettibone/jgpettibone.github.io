## The Fibonacci Sequence

A few colleagues of mine decided to test the performance of different iterative and recursive algorithms for finding the nth number of the fibonacci sequence.  Incredibly interesting.  You can see the JS Perf results [here](http://jsperf.com/fib-toy-problem/4).

Also check out the [Modern JavaScript blog on Fibonacci](http://modernjavascript.blogspot.com/2012/10/breaking-it-down-with-algorithms-ii.html).
