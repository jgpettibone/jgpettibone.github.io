I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco.

I've been working in Natural Language Processing for about 10 years.  I recently decided I wanted to learn how to build things from start to finish.  I'm currently building apps that inspire me. 

In my free time I'm a docent at the [Fine Arts Musuems of San Francisco](http://famsf.org).
